## Overview

### The project

<b>User Authentication</b><br/>
The application requires users to register and log in before they can access certain features, such as creating, sharing, commenting recipes. Users can create an account by providing their username, email address and a password. Once they have registered, they can log in using their email address and password.

They can add a new recipe by providing a recipe name, dish type, number of servings, cooking time, difficulty description, ingredients, instructions and a photo of the finished dish. Once a recipe has been created, it can be edited or deleted at any time.
